== Getting Started

Ensure that you have the Address++.jar file and the [W09-B2][Address++]SampleData.xml available on your computer and a working internet connection.

=== Importing the test data
. Launch Address++.jar.
. On initial launch, it should contain sample data of 6 different persons and 0 tasks.
. Type `open` to open a pop up window.
. Navigate to the location of the [W09-B2][Address++]SampleData.xml file and click Open to open it.
. The sample data containing 20 different persons and 7 different tasks should be loaded.
. You are now ready to begin testing.

== User Interface
* The Menu on the top of the screen contains 3 buttons: `File`, `Help` and `Font Size`.
* Below the menu is the command line, you can type your commands in here.
* The box below the command line will show feedback when you type in commands, such as if the command is successful or if you have typed an erroneous command.
* The leftmost panel contains the list of persons in the address book.
* The middle panel contains the list of tasks in the address book.
* The rightmost panel contains either the details of the selected task or person, or the in-application browser.
* The bottom bar contains miscellaneous information about the address book, such as the file where the save data will be stored and the number of persons in the address book.

== Testing
